    "#### Prompt: \n",
    "I'm a lost college student, but I know I want to start investing. I have three jobs on campus. How much of my salary should I devote to investments?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Response: \n",
    "It's great to hear you're interested in investing early! The amount of salary you should devote to investments can depend on several factors including your financial goals, your monthly expenses, and your overall financial stability. Here are a few steps to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Budgeting**: First, ensure you have a clear picture of your monthly income and expenses. This includes rent, food, transportation, and any other recurring expenses. Since you have multiple jobs, calculate your total income from all sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emergency Fund**: Before investing, it's crucial to have an emergency fund that can cover at least 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund can help you manage unforeseen expenses without disrupting your investment plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Debt Management**: If you have any high-interest debts, such as credit card debt, it might be beneficial to focus on paying these off before or alongside beginning to invest. The interest on these debts often outweighs the potential returns from investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Investment Contribution**: After accounting for your expenses and ensuring you have an emergency fund, a common guideline is to try and save and invest 15-20% of your gross income. However, even if you start with a smaller percentage, like 5-10%, it can still make a significant impact over time due to the power of compound interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Retirement Accounts**: Consider starting with retirement accounts offered by your school if you're eligible, or a Roth IRA. These accounts offer tax advantages that can enhance your investment growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you're investing for. Is it long-term security, buying a house, or early retirement? Your goals can determine how aggressively you should invest and the types of investment vehicles that are most appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Learning and Adjustment**: As you start investing, continue to educate yourself about different investment options and strategies. Also, be prepared to adjust your plan as your financial situation or goals change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting to invest while balancing school and work is commendable, and taking a thoughtful approach will help you build a strong financial foundation."

This remarkable performance, alongside developments in its business model and expansions in high-margin areas such as advertising and cloud services, suggests a positive outlook【8†source】【9†source】.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts have mixed expectations for 2024. While the average analyst's price target suggests a modest upside potential of less than 5%, some are more optimistic, predicting as much as a 30% increase from current levels, driven by improvements in Amazon's margins and growth in its cloud services segment【10†source】.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this context, if you are considering an investment in Amazon, it seems that the company's focus on expanding its high-margin businesses and strong performance in cloud computing and advertising could offer potential for growth. However, keep in mind that stock investments always come with risks, and it's important to consider how this investment fits with your overall financial goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, it may be wise to monitor any further developments or analyst updates as the year progresses."

    "If I’m looking for a long-term investment to help me pay off my student loans, what would be a sound decision?\n",

    "#### Response:\n",
    "\n",
    "Investing for student loans is a strategy that needs careful consideration. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prioritize high-interest debt:** If your student loan interest rates are higher than the potential return on your investments, focus on paying them down first.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pay minimum payments and invest extra only if:** Your loan interest rates are lower than 5%.\n",
    "Focus on debt reduction first: This provides a guaranteed return equal to your interest rate.\n",
    "Here are some alternative strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refinance your loans:** Look for a lower interest rate to free up cash for investing.\n",
    "Invest after building an emergency fund: Aim for 3-6 months of living expenses to avoid tapping investments for emergencies.\n",
    "If you decide to invest:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider a Roth IRA:** Contributions grow tax-free and can be withdrawn for qualified expenses like student loans (restrictions apply).\n",

    "#### Note: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this initial testing, we noticed a lot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Magnifi is a full financial website, not just prompt-and-response agent. The AI assitant was just one of many features on the website\n",
    "- The platform uses Plaid, a company that allows fintech services to securely connect to user's 3rd-party accounts. We were honestly initially nervous about the pressure it was putting on us to link bank accounts, but we ended up putting in Kendall's Vanguard information to see how personalized it could be \n",
    "- The AI functionality had some visible flaws as a basic level. It was hard for to click the entry bar just to type a question (something was definitely faulty on the backend), and there was noticeably incorrect grammar\n",
    "- It seems like the AI assistant runs mostly off of suggested, basic questions. Any time we asked something, it would direct us to ask the pre-loaded questions rather than continue with our own line of reasoning\n",
    "- The platform was really user friendly, but lacked the depth/surety we expected from it. It asked us really easy-to-answer questions when we engaged with the retirement prompt, but then offered no timeline, tips, or ease for the portfolio development beyond being able to add the stocks to our cart via its purchase function\n",
    "- Overall, it felt like Magnifi was made for people who already have a background in investing, know what they are doing, and just want to check specific stats or look at certain goals for which they are already planning. While the platform offers a lot for that demographic, our product will be much more entry-level and geared towards our target demographic of college students!\n",
