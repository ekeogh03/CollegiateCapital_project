    "After playing around with different LLMs, we settled on using uncensored LLMs to attempt to stop any ethical or hesitant advice. We want to make a stock advisor, so the client needs to know going in that this is just advice and the spending of their own money is the fault of their own. Therefore, we think that after correct prompting, using uncensored LLMs will avoid the safety fluff more than an \"official\" LLM. Check out our first example below using an uncensored LLM!"
