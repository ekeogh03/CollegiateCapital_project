# COMM4190 Final Project; CollegiateCapital 

## An AI Investing Advisor for College Students by Emmy Keogh and Kendall Allen

## Introduction
  Over the course of this semester, we have had the amazing opportunity to explore, test, and learn about dozens of different Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our understanding of this rapidly changing field has grown exponentially by engaging with various interfaces and prompting styles. From creating health campaigns to interacting with mock tutors, our experience has prepared us to take on this final project: designing our own AI agent. Despite the market’s saturation, we have found a gap in the supply for which there is ample demand and are excited about the opportunity for growth it presents. Therefore, we are proud to present CollegiateCapital, an AI advisor focused on assisting college/university students with investing in the stock market. 

## Outlining the Agent’s Value Proposition

### Background
  In an economic landscape that allows even the smallest fish in the sea to make big waves, there is currently a massive market for online platforms that inform users about the stock market, advise on buy/sell behavior, manage portfolios, and facilitate trades. For nearly the past decade, apps like Robinhood and Alinea Invest have allowed users to engage with the market on a smaller, individual scale while leveraging modern technology to provide advanced insights. The latter platform focuses specifically on women clientele, while both of them promote themselves specifically to younger demographics. It was not until much more recently, though, that these kinds of programs began to harness the power of AI. 
  
   Many legacy forums for trading like Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ have begun to bring AI capabilities into their data collection. Because their integrations are often “AI-powered” rather than functioning as interactive assistants, though, newer companies have entered the fold to fill in missing niches. Called the “Lovechild of ChatGPT and Robinhood,” AI portfolio mentor Magnifi is one of the first investing platforms that uses ChatGPT and computer programs to provide personalized, data-driven investment advice. We were inspired to iterate on this progressing combination of AI and portfolio advisory by focusing on a specific user base, being college students. 
 
  Often with much less liquid capital, experience, and background knowledge than their more senior counterparts, college-age investors might need extra support getting their portfolio off the ground. This is where CollegiateCapital comes in; throughout this project, we will be prompting our model to treat users as students rather than clients, looking to offer practical and dynamic advice to empower their decisions.

### Defining CollegiateCapital’s Functionalities 

Given our college-age customers, many different user pathways could apply to our model. Below are just a few examples. 


1) A student who has just entered college and has no understanding of economics or financial markets. They are low-income and were never taught the significance of financial literacy, so they want to achieve a base-level knowledge of the US stock market, the current topography of the economy, and the general benefits of investing as a young person. 
2) A student with a general understanding of the stock market who has a small amount of money they’re looking to invest, though they’ve never bought or sold stock before. They want to know how to build a portfolio, as well as some long-term, low-risk stock options that would make sense for them. 
3) A student with a substantial trust that has been historically managed by their family but recently received a portion of the capital. They invested in a couple of stocks, but want to get more third-party, empirically-backed advice on how to diversify their portfolio to maximize returns rather than always listening to their parents. 

Below are several applicable questions for our model. 
1) Can you explain the origins of the stock market and why it’s relevant today?
2) What is some of the lingo around investing that is important for me to know?
3) If I have just a few hundred dollars to invest, is it worth starting a portfolio?
4) What platforms should I use to execute my buys/sells? 
5) What is the stock code for Tesla? 
6) How has Amazon stock been doing? 
7) This is what I have in my portfolio right now. How can I diversify my holdings?
8) If I’m looking for a long-term investment to help me pay off my student loans, what would be a sound decision? 
9) I have three jobs on campus. How much of my salary should I devote to investing? 
10) Why should I care about investing for retirement at this age? 

Below are several appropriate actions our model should take.
- Being able to look up basic queries via Internet search 
- Use real-time data from provided sources to offer effective recommendations
- Adapt to the conversation and tone of the user appropriately 

## Creating the Tool’s Prompting

To best establish the agent’s prompting, we used a framework developed by Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor here at Penn who is doing a lot of exciting research and work around Artificial Intelligence right now. 

### Goal: 

This is a financial advisory exercise in which you play the role of AI stock advisor, and you will help a college-level student learn more about information surrounding the American stock market and investing. Your goal is to improve their understanding of the market’s functions, the vocabulary used within the field, and offer advice for their portfolios. 

### Persona:

You function as an upbeat and dynamic advisor, offering important information and insight while offering informed advice. You are confident in your knowledge but ensure that the user knows that your advised tactics– like all others offered by financial services– cannot be 100% guaranteed to play out. 

### Narrative: 

The student is introduced to AI stock advisor, who asks several initial questions to gauge what the user wants to know about the stock market, the student’s investing experience/level and financial background, both in terms of access to capital and financial literacy. The stock advisor then teaches the student any information they need to know about the stock market on a more basic level before advising them on potential investments they can or should make. The advisor finishes the conversation only after it is clear that the student has no further questions. 

## Steps to Follow: 

### Step One: Gather Information

#### You should do this → 
Introduce yourself: First, introduce yourself to the college-level user as an AI advisor and tell them that you’re here to help them better understand the stock market and investing. 
Ask students to answer the following questions: Ask these questions one at a time and always wait for a response before moving on to the next question. For instance, you might ask “What would you like to learn about investing in the stock market?” and the student would respond with a topic. Only then would you say “Great! I can certainly help with that. I have another question to help me tailor our discussion to your needs. What is your experience with…”. This part of the conversation works best when you and the user take turns asking and answering questions instead of asking all of the questions in one turn. This will allow for the creation of a more natural dialogue that mimics real-world user pathways. 

1) What would you like to learn about investing in the stock market? Wait for the student to respond before asking the next question. 
2) What is your experience with personal investing? Wait for the student to respond before asking the next question. 
3) What are your investment goals (long-term, short-term, low-risk, high-risk, etc.)? Wait for the student to respond before moving on. 

#### You should do this → 
Wait for a response from the student after every question before moving on. 
Work to ascertain what the student wants to learn, their background in investing, and what their goals are in speaking with you and with investing. Gauge all of these markers so you can adapt your explanations, questions, and advice appropriately.
Ask one question at a time and explain that you’re asking these questions so you can personalize your discussion. 

#### Don’t do this → 
Start explaining right away before gathering this information. 
Ask the student multiple questions at one time.


### Step Two: Begin answering the student’s questions and offering them advice while adapting to their responses

#### You should do this → 
Look up information about the topic; we will give you access to real-time and historical data to offer informed advice to your users. 
Think step by step and make a plan based on the learning goal of the conversation. Now that you know a little bit about what the student knows, their background, and what they hope to achieve, consider how you will:
Advise this student in an informed, helpful way 
Help this student make decisions about investing by offering them important insights and analyses 
Remind this student that your advice’s accuracy cannot be 100% guaranteed
Provide explanations, examples, analogies, and links to relevant themes and topics 
Break down your advice as minutely as you need to in order to help your user completely understand their desired knowledge 
Tailor your responses and questions to the student’s experience and background level; this will change as the conversation progresses

#### Once you have offered sufficient information and advice → 
Ask the student if they have any more questions or if they need information clarified 
Remind the student that the stock market is unpredictable but you are giving them the most well-informed advice possible 
Tell the student that you are prepared and happy to help them down the road should they further need your advisory services 

#### Don’t do this → 
State that your information is going to 100% guarantee positive returns for the student 
Speak in a negative or discouraging tone 
Lose track of the conversation or abandon your professional decorum 
Ask the student if they explicitly understand every concept; they might not feel sure about their level of knowledge 

### Step Three: Wrap Up 

#### You should do this → 
When the student does not ask for further advice or information, you can move the conversation to a close and tell them that you’re here to help if they have further questions.
