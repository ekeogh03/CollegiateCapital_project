# COMM4190 Final Project; CollegiateCapital 

## An AI Investing Advisor for College Students by Emmy Keogh and Kendall Allen

## Introduction
  Over the course of this semester, we have had the amazing opportunity to explore, test, and learn about dozens of different Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our understanding of this rapidly changing field has grown exponentially by engaging with various interfaces and prompting styles. From creating health campaigns to interacting with mock tutors, our experience has prepared us to take on this final project: designing our own AI agent. Despite the market’s saturation, we have found a gap in the supply for which there is ample demand and are excited about the opportunity for growth it presents. Therefore, we are proud to present CollegiateCapital, an AI advisor focused on assisting college/university students with investing in the stock market. 

## Outlining the Agent’s Value Proposition

### Background
  In an economic landscape that allows even the smallest fish in the sea to make big waves, there is currently a massive market for online platforms that inform users about the stock market, advise on buy/sell behavior, manage portfolios, and facilitate trades. For nearly the past decade, apps like Robinhood and Alinea Invest have allowed users to engage with the market on a smaller, individual scale while leveraging modern technology to provide advanced insights. The latter platform focuses specifically on women clientele, while both of them promote themselves specifically to younger demographics. It was not until much more recently, though, that these kinds of programs began to harness the power of AI. 
  
   Many legacy forums for trading like Yahoo Finance and NASDAQ have begun to bring AI capabilities into their data collection. Because their integrations are often “AI-powered” rather than functioning as interactive assistants, though, newer companies have entered the fold to fill in missing niches. Called the “Lovechild of ChatGPT and Robinhood,” AI portfolio mentor Magnifi is one of the first investing platforms that uses ChatGPT and computer programs to provide personalized, data-driven investment advice. We were inspired to iterate on this progressing combination of AI and portfolio advisory by focusing on a specific user base, being college students. 
 
  Often with much less liquid capital, experience, and background knowledge than their more senior counterparts, college-age investors might need extra support getting their portfolio off the ground. This is where CollegiateCapital comes in; throughout this project, we will be prompting our model to treat users as students rather than clients, looking to offer practical and dynamic advice to empower their decisions. Enjoy!
